Have you ever had a moment when you were typing up notes for class, or for work when suddenly the internet runs out? There have been plenty of times that has happened, and when the internet does come back online you see that your data was not stored which can be very frustrating. 

Wellnot any more with the help of the `text-editor app caching`. With this app you are able to store all of your notes while you have internet and then when the internet goes out, your notes are still saved. Not only does this make it easier for all users that are `on computers` but the app `is also` compatible with `mobile as well`. This app is a `downloadable` app using PWA and the use of heroku.
